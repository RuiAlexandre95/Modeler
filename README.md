# Modeler
Open 3D Modeling Tool 

This tool is written in Kotlin, using [LWJGL3](https://www.lwjgl.org/) for rendering and [Legui](https://github.com/cout970/legui) to build user interfaces

The program is in beta so if you find a bug please report it as soon as possible.

### Formatts
Valid input formats:
- OBJ: Wavefront .obj file
- TCN: Techne model format (outdated 3d modeler)
- TBL: [Tabula model format](https://github.com/iChun/Tabula)
- JSON: [Minecraft json models](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Model)
- MCX: Custom model format used in [ModeLoader](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/modelloader)
- GLTF: mostly supported

Valid output formats:
- OBJ: Wavefront .obj file
- MCX: Custom model format used in [ModeLoader](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/modelloader)
- GLTF: mostly support, has animations
- VS: Vintage Story model format (not all features are supported)

The formats TCN, TBL and JSON are based on storing objects as cubes with properties, they don't allow 
arbitrary kinds of shapes so it's impossible to export complex models to them.
